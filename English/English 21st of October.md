As of today English is used worldwide in many fields such as computer science. It is first of all used for the key words in different languages, not understanding those key words can be very problematic as it could limit us in our understanding of what we are writing. Moreover compilers almost always send error messages in English and if we don't understand it we can't correct them.
Also most if not all of the vocabulary linked to computer science is in English, so not understanding it is a real problem.
